two strings, s1hid s2.
It will open the file <filename>hid copies its content into a new file
<filename>.replace, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.

the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace. Use them
wisely!
Of course, handle unexpected inputshid errors. You have to create and turn in yourhid turn in your
own tests to ensure your program works as expected.
